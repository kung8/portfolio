The ramen itself is so filling that you shouldn\'t need any appetizers. I have had their gyozas and their karaage chicken, good but nothing spectacular.",

                "I love the ramen here. I have gotten two different kinds - Haku and the Miso. The noodles are interchangeable, so if you want more of the Haku broth but the yellow thicker noodles you can do that. By this point I have been there about 7 or 8 times, and one experience the food was okay so that's why I am giving it a 4. This still hits the spot if you want good ramen. It's closer to where I live so I come here. It's not as busy and the service is probably much better here since it's not as busy. The ramen here is also filling that you wouldn't need any appetizers.",
