                "Wow I just finished Book Lover and I absolutely loved it. I’m a sucker for romantic comedies. It hit me hard around the middle of the book where I was able to connect with the main character Nora at more of a personal level. I felt she and I were the same even though we haven’t had exactly the same experiences. This book is definitely worth a read. I love Emily Henry’s writing—full of humor, witty, chock full of cultural references. There were some descriptive sensual scenes scattered in several parts throughout the book."

Mom and Libby liked the love stories where everything turned out perfectly, wrapped in a bow, and I've always wondered why I gravitate toward something else. I used to think it was because people like me don't get those endings. And asking for it, hoping for it, is a way to lose something you've never even had. The ones that speak to me are those whose final pages admit there is no going back. That every good thing must end. That every bad thing does too, that everything does. That is what I'm looking for everything time I flip to the back of the book, compulsively checking for proof that in a life where so many things have gone wrong, there can be beauty too. That there is always hope, no matter what. After losing Mom, those were the endings I found solace in. The ones that said, Yes, you have lost something, but maybe, someday, you'll find something too. For a decade, I've known I will never again have everything, and so all I've wanted is to believe that someday, again, I'll have enough. The ache won't always be so bad. People like me aren't beyond repair. No ice ever freezes too thick to thaw and no thorns ever grow too dense too dense to be cut away. This book has crushed me with its weight and dazzled me with its tiny bright spots. Some book you don't read so much live, and finishing one of those always makes me think of ascending from a scuba dive. Like if I surface too fast I might get the bends.",

It taught great principles about finding peace and balance in your life that doesn't require you to be a workaholic. Though a majority of the examples ended with people leaving their careers to pursue their personal life. I don't think there were enough examples of people who found peace while still working. I think it's possible to find that balance without giving up a good job, but I guess that's the whole point of the book."

I wasn't a fan initially of the back and forth with the past and present, but I understand some of the past memories/snippets told at the right time made much more sense when I read them (or at least with the current context and fresh details). I was pleasantly surprised by the ending and glad it ended the way it did."

                "Well written just like the other hunger games books. The details weren't as gruesome as the other books but psychologically it was thrilling to see the devolution of Coriolanus. He reverted into bouts of thoughts that has morphed him to the character we meet in the Hunger Games series. Fascinating and appalling at the same time. The optimistic side of me wants to believe that Lucy Gray survived. To think a society could throw in children into an arena, to maintain control and order they have set up essentially prisons. I think of refugees who escape their countries of origin to find safer places to live and how Panem didn't offer that. They literally would have to live on their own leaving behind everyone and everything."

There were some truths that I forget sometimes about friendly fire, split second decision to kill or be killed, things that military service men and women deal with on a daily. Honestly I wouldn't have been able to have read this book, listening is the only way for this one.

                "A lot of mystery behind the past of the family. There was a lot of hinting at murders that had been ruled as accidents or suicide. When the first murder happened in the book I was thinking oh yeah the title of this book. The clues in the poems for each of the days went over my head but after the characters deciphered them, I was like that's a good one. The writing was good, I felt like there were some minor typos but with the anagram puzzle hidden within the book I just shrugged those off. I guessed the real killer after the second murder with some doubt about another character but was blown away by some other details. Thoughts around the book though it's wild how money can cause people to kill. It's ridiculous that that is even true today and how people lose themselves trying to capture riches and power and influence."

Avery is forced to live in the mansion for a least a year or else she gives up the fortune and it is given to charity. The disinherited family are still able to live at this mansion on the condition they don't get kicked out and Avery can only kick them out for good reasons. She is intrigued with games and puzzles and gets sucked into this game that one of the Hawthorne grandsons believes is the reason why she's here. She also wants to know why did the grandfather choose her to leave this fortune. Well written. I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed writing. The humor, wittiness of Avery and the grandsons. The games and puzzles were interesting. I would love to continue reading more books by this author."

But I suppose it was important. I didn't think there was actually any mystery. But as soon as Bod left the graveyard to go to school, things became much better. This book reminded me of Pinocchio where he doesn't seem to belong where he is at and is curious about things and is innocent. And he learns to do the right thing eventually. This book I listened to as an audiobook."

However as soon I passed a lot of the backstory and focused on the progression of the crime it became great! I enjoyed the mystery and it seemed to have potentially two mysteries in it. The ending felt like it dragged on but I am glad I stuck it out to the end. Some confusing things presented itself with the deaths but it got clarified at the end. "

Nearly after the main character, Erin, starts to act on her intuition things started to get interesting but it took way too long to get to that point. There were some parts that it went into too many details unnecessarily like the part where she describes how a Glock 22 works."

It was a lot of build up and I never felt like I couldn't put the book down until around the last quarter of the book. Spoiler alert there's a poisoning. The biggest takeaway from the book was to not let money change who you are. It's crazy how poorly people treated their employees because they had money. One of the characters I really liked, but turned out to be a monster. The story of Michael and Astrid is something that I am always scared about happening to me, I am someone who can relate to Michael's story of having to work very hard to get to where I am today (not without help from others btw) and I don't ever want to make others feel bad around me. I have recognized I have lived a more lavish lifestyle with buying Legos and pretty much what I have wanted without considering finances the past couple of years. I need to be better. "

At times I kept saying this is the last chapter but then he left me wanting to read more especially since it was very short chapters. The physical connection between this book and the Silent Patient was great where he bridged the two main characters' story and intertwined their universes. I enjoyed the romantic tease and that the characters at some point were up on the chopping block in my mind of the killers. Each could have had a motive and some of the journal entries from the killer was probably kept me the most intrigued as they evolved into that killer."

It means people would be unhappy because the lack of choice. It means stagnation as a society. It means living off the backs of others. The fact that memories were taken away from people and that people were taking their pills to suppress their feelings is worrisome. I am glad that I have the ability to choose. This simple book was thought provoking and has given me a better appreciation of the world I live in."
