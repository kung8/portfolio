This was the first of the Brandon Sanderson books that I’ve read and it was so good. I’m going to be reading more of his books. I really enjoyed the way his characters were more than just two dimensional in the sense they had personalities and backstories. The amount of details that he puts into this book made me connect with them. I really enjoyed the storyline. "

They must work together to save their species. It is beautifully written. I wasn't a fan initially of the back and forth with the past and present, but I understand some of the past memories/snippets told at the right time made much more sense when I read them (or at least with the current context and fresh details). I was pleasantly surprised by the ending and glad it ended the way it did."

                "Well written just like the other hunger games books. The details weren't as gruesome as the other books but psychologically it was thrilling to see the devolution of Coriolanus. He reverted into bouts of thoughts that has morphed him to the character we meet in the Hunger Games series. Fascinating and appalling at the same time. The optimistic side of me wants to believe that Lucy Gray survived. To think a society could throw in children into an arena, to maintain control and order they have set up essentially prisons. I think of refugees who escape their countries of origin to find safer places to live and how Panem didn't offer that. They literally would have to live on their own leaving behind everyone and everything."

I have deep respect for those in the military because they are fighting for peace and freedom for our country and those that are suffering in other countries. There were some truths that I forget sometimes about friendly fire, split second decision to kill or be killed, things that military service men and women deal with on a daily. Honestly I wouldn't have been able to have read this book, listening is the only way for this one. I felt the book could have been shorter, the beginning was annoying - it felt the author was trying to convince me he was credible and didn't just jump into the principles. I did like the practical business applications.",

                "A lot of mystery behind the past of the family. There was a lot of hinting at murders that had been ruled as accidents or suicide. When the first murder happened in the book I was thinking oh yeah the title of this book. The clues in the poems for each of the days went over my head but after the characters deciphered them, I was like that's a good one. The writing was good, I felt like there were some minor typos but with the anagram puzzle hidden within the book I just shrugged those off. I guessed the real killer after the second murder with some doubt about another character but was blown away by some other details. Thoughts around the book though it's wild how money can cause people to kill. It's ridiculous that that is even true today and how people lose themselves trying to capture riches and power and influence."

This book I listened to as an audiobook."

However as soon I passed a lot of the backstory and focused on the progression of the crime it became great! I enjoyed the mystery and it seemed to have potentially two mysteries in it. The ending felt like it dragged on but I am glad I stuck it out to the end. Some confusing things presented itself with the deaths but it got clarified at the end. "

It was a lot of build up and I never felt like I couldn't put the book down until around the last quarter of the book. Spoiler alert there's a poisoning. The biggest takeaway from the book was to not let money change who you are. It's crazy how poorly people treated their employees because they had money. One of the characters I really liked, but turned out to be a monster. The story of Michael and Astrid is something that I am always scared about happening to me, I am someone who can relate to Michael's story of having to work very hard to get to where I am today (not without help from others btw) and I don't ever want to make others feel bad around me. I have recognized I have lived a more lavish lifestyle with buying Legos and pretty much what I have wanted without considering finances the past couple of years. I need to be better. "

At times I kept saying this is the last chapter but then he left me wanting to read more especially since it was very short chapters. The physical connection between this book and the Silent Patient was great where he bridged the two main characters' story and intertwined their universes. I enjoyed the romantic tease and that the characters at some point were up on the chopping block in my mind of the killers. Each could have had a motive and some of the journal entries from the killer was probably kept me the most intrigued as they evolved into that killer."

Couldn't put the book down especially after I got to the part where he started to interview her and eventually met a few culprits. I read the remainder of the book in the night (starting from around page 67 to the rest of the book). It was a surprise ending for sure. The psychology behind this is something very interesting to me."

Everything really is made up of atoms and if we utilize that knowledge we can make a lot of things happen. The book is chalked full of humorous moments and quotes especially by the main character Watney. The resilience and ingenuity and resourcefulness he showcases is remarkable and it literally saved his life. It was great to hear that most of the world is good and wanted to help him out."

The fact that memories were taken away from people and that people were taking their pills to suppress their feelings is worrisome. I am glad that I have the ability to choose. This simple book was thought provoking and has given me a better appreciation of the world I live in."
