This book had a lot of science in it like The Martian and Project Hail Mary. There was a ton of swearing in this book but it was all part of this character's personality. The story kept getting better and better as I read."

                "This book has taught me a lot about relationships haha. I think that fighting and conflict resolution is very important. I believe that not all romantic relationships need to avoid separations and divorces, but it's important to resolve what you can and learn how to empathize with your partner. Emily Henry again does such a great job captivating the world in a witty, funny and romantic way. The back and forth of the past and the present isn't everyone's cup of tea, but in this book it was really well done and needed. It kept some suspense and mystery in the book."

It hit me hard around the middle of the book where I was able to connect with the main character Nora at more of a personal level. I felt she and I were the same even though we haven't had exactly the same experiences. This book is definitely worth a read. I love Emily Henry's writing—full of humor, witty, chock full of cultural references. There were some descriptive sensual scenes scattered in several parts throughout the book."

I used to think it was because people like me don't get those endings. And asking for it, hoping for it, is a way to lose something you've never even had. The ones that speak to me are those whose final pages admit there is no going back. That every good thing must end. That every bad thing does too, that everything does. That is what I'm looking for everything time I flip to the back of the book, compulsively checking for proof that in a life where so many things have gone wrong, there can be beauty too. That there is always hope, no matter what. After losing Mom, those were the endings I found solace in. The ones that said, Yes, you have lost something, but maybe, someday, you'll find something too. For a decade, I've known I will never again have everything, and so all I've wanted is to believe that someday, again, I'll have enough. The ache won't always be so bad. People like me aren't beyond repair. No ice ever freezes too thick to thaw and no thorns ever grow too dense too dense to be cut away.

It taught great principles about finding peace and balance in your life that doesn't require you to be a workaholic. Though a majority of the examples ended with people leaving their careers to pursue their personal life. I don't think there were enough examples of people who found peace while still working. I think it's possible to find that balance without giving up a good job, but I guess that's the whole point of the book."

He reverted into bouts of thoughts that has morphed him to the character we meet in the Hunger Games series. Fascinating and appalling at the same time. The optimistic side of me wants to believe that Lucy Gray survived. To think a society could throw in children into an arena, to maintain control and order they have set up essentially prisons. I think of refugees who escape their countries of origin to find safer places to live and how Panem didn't offer that. They literally would have to live on their own leaving behind everyone and everything."

Honestly I wouldn't have been able to have read this book, listening is the only way for this one.

When the first murder happened in the book I was thinking oh yeah the title of this book. The clues in the poems for each of the days went over my head but after the characters deciphered them, I was like that's a good one. The writing was good, I felt like there were some minor typos but with the anagram puzzle hidden within the book I just shrugged those off. I guessed the real killer after the second murder with some doubt about another character but was blown away by some other details. Thoughts around the book though it's wild how money can cause people to kill. It's ridiculous that that is even true today and how people lose themselves trying to capture riches and power and influence."

This book was a good continuation of the first book. I enjoyed the humor, not as much as I did the first book though. There were some puzzles in here."

                "An interesting mystery about a random girl who inherits the Hawthorne billions instead of the family that thought would own this fortune. Avery is forced to live in the mansion for a least a year or else she gives up the fortune and it is given to charity. The disinherited family are still able to live at this mansion on the condition they don't get kicked out and Avery can only kick them out for good reasons. She is intrigued with games and puzzles and gets sucked into this game that one of the Hawthorne grandsons believes is the reason why she's here. She also wants to know why did the grandfather choose her to leave this fortune. Well written. I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed writing. The humor, wittiness of Avery and the grandsons. The games and puzzles were interesting. I would love to continue reading more books by this author."

I thought this book was well written and I loved the interactions that Siobhan had with her siblings and as well as the inspector MacDara. It was cute and kind of felt familiar."

The relationship of a mother and a stepdaughter is interesting. Disney has portrayed stepmothers being awfully cruel and unfair. But Hannah comes with her own past and an understanding of losing a mother so playing that mother figure role in someone else's life can mean a lot. This book was well written. It was understandable even when there was a lot of back and forth with the present and past."

                "Sequel to the beloved Crazy Rich Asians, not as good as the first. It's more of a drama and very interested in how they will portray it in the movie. It was a lot of build up and I never felt like I couldn't put the book down until around the last quarter of the book. Spoiler alert there's a poisoning. The biggest takeaway from the book was to not let money change who you are. It's crazy how poorly people treated their employees because they had money. One of the characters I really liked, but turned out to be a monster. The story of Michael and Astrid is something that I am always scared about happening to me, I am someone who can relate to Michael's story of having to work very hard to get to where I am today (not without help from others btw) and I don't ever want to make others feel bad around me. I have recognized I have lived a more lavish lifestyle with buying Legos and pretty much what I have wanted without considering finances the past couple of years. I need to be better. "

                "Another one of Alex's great writings. I enjoyed the intrigue and this fantastic mystery. At times I kept saying this is the last chapter but then he left me wanting to read more especially since it was very short chapters. The physical connection between this book and the Silent Patient was great where he bridged the two main characters' story and intertwined their universes. I enjoyed the romantic tease and that the characters at some point were up on the chopping block in my mind of the killers. Each could have had a motive and some of the journal entries from the killer was probably kept me the most intrigued as they evolved into that killer."

I almost decided to not continue with this book but it got better as Poppy's quirkiness came out and this forbidden love emerged between these two characters. You really only get the perspective of Poppy and can only guess what Alex is feeling. The dynamic of their relationship is truly something. I loved the pop culture references. This book was hilarious."

Everything really is made up of atoms and if we utilize that knowledge we can make a lot of things happen. The book is chalked full of humorous moments and quotes especially by the main character Watney. The resilience and ingenuity and resourcefulness he showcases is remarkable and it literally saved his life. It was great to hear that most of the world is good and wanted to help him out."
