        'Season the chicken with salt.',
        'Set up the three dredging stations in separate small bowls: (1) flour, (2) egg, and (3) panko bread crumbs.',
        'First dredge the chicken in flour and shake off any excess. A good way to do this is playing pat-a-cake with it between each hand. Be sure to keep it over the flour station.',
        'Dip it inside the egg bowl.',
        'Finally put it inside the panko bread crumbs bowl and make sure that it is well coated.',
        'Place the finished chicken on a plate that will be fried soon. Repeat the dredging process for each of the chicken breasts.',
        'Heat oil in a pot over medium heat until it gets to about 350 ÂºF. You can use a cooking thermometer to gauge this.',
        'Be careful as the oil is very hot by this point, so be sure to wear oven mitts to help protect your hands from getting burned.',
        'Place the chicken breast in the hot oil, and cook for 3 - 4 minutes per side.',
        'Place the finished chicken breast on a cooling rack lined with about 2 paper towel layers',
        'Repeat this for each chicken breast.',
        'Serve with rice and optionally with tomato, cabbage, and lemon slices (squeezed over chicken, or cabbage, or both) and enjoy this Japanese goodness!',
