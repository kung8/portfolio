Flatten the dough using a rolling pin until it's about 8 inches wide and you will place your closed fists beneath it (at about 10-and-2 steering wheel position). The tricky part is to avoid tearing the dough by making it too thin and accidentally ripping the dough with your fingers. So tuck those fingers in and use just your knuckles.`, section: SECTIONS.FORM_DOUGH },
