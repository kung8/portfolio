                    Hello my name is Kevin Ung. I am an aspiring web developer who loves the exciting challenge of problem solving and passionate about learning both formally and informally. I am always down to play Ultimate Frisbee. I love all types of music -- my favorite would have to be acoustic covers of popular songs. Cooking is no fun unless you are cooking for more than yourself, so let me know and I will make you something. I wished I had the chance to travel more but I have loved exploring different parts of the world.
